            <h2>BattleVerse tokens</h2>
            <p>  
            BattleVerse tokens (hereinafter referred to as "QZQ & BVC") issued by BattleVerse are not intended to constitute securities or grant of any ownership rights, units in a business trust, or units in a collective investment scheme, or any other regulated products in any jurisdiction.
            You should NOT expect any profits based on your purchase or holding of QZQ & BVC, and BattleVerse makes no promises that you will make any profits. QZQ & BVC is intended to act as a medium of exchange between users in the BattleVerse metaverse. QZQ & BVC are NOT investment products and there should be NO expectation of future profit or gain from the purchase, sale, or holding of QZQ & BVC.
            </p>  
            <h4>QZQ & BVC do NOT represent:</h4>
            <p>  
            any equity or other ownership interest in BattleVerse or its affiliates;
            any rights to dividends or other distribution rights from BattleVerse or its affiliates;
            any governance rights in BattleVerse or its affiliates, except DAO functionality expressly described in this Whitepaper.
            </p>  
            <p>  
            For example, if you buy QZQ & BVC at some point in the future, this won't mean you “own a piece of BattleVerse” QZQ & BVC do not give their holders any special rights, just like owning Euro doesn’t give you shares in the European Union.
            </p>  
            <p>  
            In deciding whether to purchase QZQ & BVC, you should be fully aware of the risk that QZQ & BVC may decrease in value over time or even lose all monetary value. There are a number of risks related to purchasing cryptocurrencies like QZQ & BVC, including volatility in cryptocurrency markets, the possibility of increased regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges, and other risks.
