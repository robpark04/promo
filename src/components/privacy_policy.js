By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing.

We ask you not to share the password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will take all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access.

        4. How long do we retain your data for
      </h2>
      <p>
        We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any accounting or legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine the appropriate retention period for the personal information we hold, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the reasons why we handle your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
        In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

      <h2>
        5. Your rights as a data subject (GDPR)

        You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>
        the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;
        you withdraw your consent to consent-based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
        you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;
        we unlawfully processed your personal information;

      </p>
      <h3>
        HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT GENERALLY ALLOW FOR DATA TO BE DELETED AND YOUR RIGHT TO ERASURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS HELD BY US IS PERMANENTLY DELETED.
      </h3>
      <p>

        The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
        Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing
        You have a right to restrict the processing of your personal information, such as where:
      </p>
      <p>
        you contest the accuracy of the personal information;
        where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
        we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
        You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
      </p>

        HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, AS IT IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK, WE WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT EXTERNAL PARTIES FROM PROCESSING ANY PERSONAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN.

        Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)
      </h2>

        Privacy Notice for California Residents
      </h3>
      <p>
        This Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in BattleVerse Privacy Policy applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (”consumers” or “you”). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents' personal information to others: 1) must give notice to California residents before selling their personal information to others; and 2) must provide the right to opting out of the sale of their personal information. BattleVerse does not sell and has not in the past 12 months sold personal information, including personal information of anyone under 16 years old. Thus, these notification and opt-out requirements do not apply to BattleVerse.
